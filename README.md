This package is a work in progress. Please reach out to the authors
before using.

# Scope

*incidence2* adds additional functionality to the
[incidence2](https://github.com/reconhub/incidence2) package.

# What does it do?

The main features of the package include:

  - **`rolling_average`** and **`remove_rolling`**: add or remove a
    rolling average to/from an `incidence()` object.

  - **`bootstrap()`**: generates a bootstrapped `incidence()` object by
    re-sampling, with replacement, the original dates of events.

  - **`find_peak()`**: locates the peak time of the epicurve.

  - **`estimate_peak()`**: uses bootstrap to estimate the peak time (and
    related confidence interval) of a partially observed outbreak. We
    can use **`tidy()`** to generate nicer looking output.
