* Apologies I may have been to eager in my submission after the upstream incidence2 package was pushed to CRAN.
* Original submission (0.1.1) due to changes in upstream incidence2
* This re-submission (0.1.2) also bumps the minimum requirements for incidence2 to be 1.2.0.

## Test environments
* Fedora 34, R Under development (unstable) (2021-07-07 r80604)

## R CMD check results
